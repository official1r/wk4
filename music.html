              <h2>Country</h2>
              <p>Country music can be traced back to the beginning of the twentieth century. It was created mainly in the south of the USA, by working-class people. These people would use country as a means to tell stories through music, about the realities of everyday life and their perspectives.</p>

                <h2>Rock</h2>
                <p>One of the top musical genres in existence, rock music originated in the 1940s and 50s in the form of rock & roll. However, its roots can be traced back to the rhythm and blues of the African-American culture in the 1920s, merged with country music.</p>

                <h2>Pop</h2>
                <p>Pop music is perhaps the most obvious addition to this list. It could be said that pop is a compilation of other genres, which are considered to be mainstream in a certain time period.</p>
